# University of Sydney - INFO1110 Assignment
## Semester 1 2024

The aim of the assignment was to create an approximation of a photonic circuit, where emitters emit photons that are received by receivers.

At time of submission, 94/96 testcases were passed. This will be update in the future so hopefully 100% of tests can be passed and formatting is updated.
